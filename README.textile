I implemented this scrapper because I was sick and tired of looking up episode titles of my favorite TV shows and renaming every file manually.
This scrapper will browse multiple IMDB pages and get infos about the episodes.

Currently the following shows will be processed:
-Big Bang Theory
-Californication
-30 Rock
-How I Met Your Mother
-Scrubs
-Fringe
More might come. My preferred solution would be to hand over the IMDB link to a specific show via the API, but I haven't found out how to do that yet.
Currently, the following data keys will be generated:
-series_title
-nr
-season
-episode
-airdate
-link
-airdate
-episode_title
-description

I hope this is helpful to someone else.
